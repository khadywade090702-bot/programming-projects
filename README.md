# Programming Projects

This is a collection of my programming projects created on OnlineGDB during my studies at Hudson County Community College.  
These projects demonstrate my skills in Java, including loops, functions, conditionals, and user input handling.



## Included Files

**BankInterest.java** – Calculates simple bank interest based on principal, rate, and time.  
**Do-While.java** – Demonstrates how to use the do...while loop structure in Java.  
**Test2.java** – Basic exercise using conditional statements (if, else if, else).  
**Test3.java** – Combines loops and functions to solve a logical programming task.  
**TestFinal.java** – Final Java project that brings together loops, conditions, and user input.
**AssurancePlan.java** – A program that calculates insurance plans or premiums based on user data.  
**StudentGrade.java** – Calculates student grades and displays average performance using conditions.  
**MilitarySchoolEnrollment.java** – Simulates a basic enrollment system using Java input and validation.
